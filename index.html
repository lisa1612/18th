            HAPPYYYY 18TH BIRTHDAYY!!<br><br>
            Happyy 18th Birthdayy Bebo!! You're finally a WHOLE ADULT??!! How did you grow up so fast?! sorry WHYY did you grow up ever! This cute adorable little baby that I asked god for to share my skirts with?? You're literally my best gift! And you don't fail your purpose on this earth - to steal clothes from my wardrobe. <br>
            I know I keep saying that you're still small, how can you be 18??!! but even though you're a full FIVE years YOUNGER THAN ME you're already very much an adult like me. How are you the one listening to my craziness and giving me advice?! There's literally no one else i want to tell something to when I'm filled with anger or frustration, or when i'm jumping with excitement and delusional ideas! I mean no one else who's my age or older would ever understand or match my energy! My God my BEST FRIEND is my little sister and i do not hate it even a little bit! yeah yeah so sad for me! But like?? Whoâ€™s to blame when I got a cool pseudo-adult for a sister?? And between you and me, I wouldnâ€™t have it any other way.
            <br>
            From the moment you were born, I loved you in a way I never knew was possible. You were this tiny little thing, and I knew from that day on that I would always be there for you, protecting you, cheering you on, and loving you. Well I might have made you fall with my tiny slippery hands one or two times, so I might be part of the reason why you are a little crazy in the head, but well I'm not sorry. Over the years, Iâ€™ve watched you grow into the most incredible person, and my love for you has only deepened with time ( & distance)
            <br>
            We fought over toys, TV remotes, measurement of glasses of juice, hugs?, the list goes on and on to the tiniest of little things! We drove each other insane. But looking back, I wouldnâ€™t change a single argument, a single eye-roll, a single moment of chaosâ€”because every fight only brought us closer, only we didn't know it at the time. Then all of a sudden life happened! I went away, first for college, then for work, leaving you home to face the realities of our home, alone. And the distance did something unexpectedâ€”it made us inseparable. I cannot for the life of me remember the moment the switch happened, but it did and I'm so grateful for it! Now, thereâ€™s nothing we donâ€™t share. The deepest, darkest secrets. The wildest, most unhinged delusions. The kind of conversations no one else in the world would ever understand. Somehow our life started moving in the same orbit but in different timelines. Every feeling I had already felt, every crazy experience I had, you were having your own version of it. Maybe this was why we always somehow understood each other! Because however different we may be! we feel the same way about so many things! You went from being my annoying little sister to my safe space, my ride-or-die. HOW DID THAT HAPPEN!!
            <br>
            You are everything I never knew I needed and more, even if you donâ€™t always see it. You think youâ€™re not pretty enough, not smart enough, not good enoughâ€”but let me tell you, you are all of those things and more, a thousand times over. You are beautiful, inside and out. Youâ€™re so incredibly smart and capable and you're the funniest person I know!! The way you take care of Amma and worry about her even after the countless fights you have, the way you don't want to hurt anybody and want the best for everyone even if you don't get the same treatment from them leaves me in awe (well there are some extreme people pleasing tendencies we both have and needs a talk with a therapist but that is a conversation for another day)You are everything that this world needs, and Iâ€™m so lucky to have you as my sister, my best freakin friend!!
            <br>
            A little grown up advice? Don't grow up! You'll be off to college soon. A whole new world! A new fantastic point of view. No one to tell us "No", or where to go, or say we're only dreaming!! Okay I was just quoting Aladdin! But yes this is the precipice of Adulting. Jump at all the opportunities you get. You will make new friends (if you think you are nervous there is always someone more nervous than you!), you will learn new things (and not from textbooks), you will be responsible for yourself! It all sounds so scary this huge new step of getting out of home and being an Adult! But remember when it all gets too much you can just be a child be all weird and crazy and come back home and I'll be here for you! But you'll be great! I have no doubt! I canâ€™t wait to see everything you accomplish. I know there are so many amazing things in store for youâ€”things that will blow your mind and make you realize just how incredibly talented and extraordinary you are. You are going to shine, and Iâ€™ll be right here, cheering you on every step of the way.
            <br>
            Here's wishing you an amazing time ahead!! Filled with great friends, adventures, laughter and opportunities!! and for US?? many many Buldak yap sessions, hour long video calls, girl dates to Starbucks, going shopping together to play dress up, travelling together, to finding love, building a home, to all the things we dreamed up together since the time we started watching Barbie together!! There's no one else I would want to do it with!! I know we don't say it and we don't need to, but still I hope you know how much I love you!! No words will ever be enough to describe it! You mean the world to me Bebo! and I LOVE YOU SOO SOO MUCH!!
            Seriously! Truly! Indefinitely!!
            <br>
            Uff! That's a lot of emotion in one letter! You won't be getting another one like this for five more years so soak it up! hehe! Love you byotch! Have a fantastic birthdayyy!! I cannot wait to come home and celebrate it with you in style!! and also smother you with my hugs!! 
            MUAHH! XO!
            <br><br>
            Love always,<br>
